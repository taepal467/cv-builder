# CV Builder Project

- Another T.O.P project completed! After tons of research using Google , YouTube and looking at other people's code, I was finally able to complete this project using React class components. 


- The information you enter in the inputs will be displayed accordingly in the Resume template.


- The textarea is expandable vertically. Just have to drag from the bottom right hand corner.


- The CV Builder project is mobile friendly.


## Resources
- [A component is changing an uncontrolled input to be controlled](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/react-component-changing-uncontrolled-input#:~:text=The%20warning%20%22A%20component%20is,%3D%7Bmessage%20%7C%7C%20''%7D%20.) - when building this project, I kept getting the warning 'A component is changing an uncontrolled input to be controlled'. This article helps to get rid of that warning by adding " || '' " to value={ anyValue || '' }.


- [Input textbox shadow](https://codepen.io/Mohammed_Moustafa/pen/zreYaW) - This is what I used to style the inputs.
